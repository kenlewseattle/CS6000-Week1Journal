	abstract = {In order for two sensors within a body area network to determine they are on the same body, e.g., for security purposes, extensive prior work considers the use of physiological values. We study the practicality of using body physiological values for securely exchanging messages for sharing keys. Due to its popularity in the literature, we use electrocardiography (ECG) signals, and show that cardiac physiology is incompatible with such schemes, due to the sensitivity to a node’s deployment location on the body and the outsiders’ capability to remotely sense the physiological value.},

	abstract = {Recent ﬁndings have shown that network and system attacks in Software-Deﬁned Networks (SDNs) have been caused by malicious network applications that misuse APIs in an SDN controller. Such attacks can both crash the controller and change the internal data structure in the controller, causing serious damage to the infrastructure of SDN-based networks. To address this critical security issue, we introduce a security framework called AEGIS to prevent controller APIs from being misused by malicious network applications. Through the run-time veriﬁcation of API calls, AEGIS performs a ﬁnegrained access control for important controller APIs that can be misused by malicious applications. The usage of API calls is veriﬁed in real time by sophisticated security access rules that are deﬁned based on the relationships between applications and data in the SDN controller. We also present a prototypical implementation of AEGIS and demonstrate its eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency by performing six diﬀerent controller attacks including new attacks we have recently discovered.},

	abstract = {Moving target defense (MTD) is useful for thwarting network reconnaissance and preventing unauthorized access. While previous research in MTD focuses on protecting the endnodes, we leverage software-defined networking to implement MTD on the data-plane switches, which significantly decreases the controller communication overhead and enables quicker defense response to reduce the attack impact. This paper not only randomizes the IP addresses for MTD but also uses the IP addresses for synchronization across the nodes in the networking path by generating hash-chain-based synchronization signatures. Our scheme is practical as it builds on and encodes the existing IP addresses for randomization to construct a modular solution independent to the routing/flow rule implementation and does not incur additional networking overhead except for the seed distribution (which can occur offline). Our scheme is also effective (the attacker's required cost to achieve timely network reconnaissance increases by more than an order of magnitude than the previous state-of-the-art having the controller actuate the MTD randomization) and scalable (the relative overhead cost of our scheme becomes smaller as the network grows). We analyze our scheme and implement and experiment it on an Open vSwitch-based testbed and on CloudLab to validate these properties.},

	abstract = {In wireless networks, users share a transmission medium. To increase the eﬃciency of channel usage, wireless systems often use a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to perform channel coordination by having each node announce its usage intentions; other nodes avoid making conﬂicting transmissions minimizing interference both to the node that has announced its intentions and to a node that cooperates by avoiding transmissions during the reserved slot. Traditionally, in a multi-channel environment, such announcements are made on a common control channel. However, this control channel is vulnerable to jamming because its location is pre-assigned and known to attackers. Furthermore, the announcements themselves provide information useful for jamming. In this paper, we focus on a situation where multiple wireless transmitters share spectrum in the presence of intelligent and possibly insider jammers capable of dynamically and adaptively changing their jamming patterns.},
