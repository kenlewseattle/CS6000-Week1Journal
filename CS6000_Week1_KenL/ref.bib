	abstract = {Information and product visibilities have been crucial in today’s supply chain processes, as economic, environmental and social sustainability concepts, which have been frequently focused on in recent years, prioritize the transparency of business processes. Blockchain technology, with continuously expanding application areas, has been revealed to be applicable in supply chain processes. On the other hand, integration of blockchain technology into supply chain processes will not be as smooth as estimated, since some challenges and constraints have already been identiﬁed. Therefore, companies aiming to integrate blockchain into supply chain processes should qualify and investigate each of these challenges. In the literature, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no study addressing the issues arising during the integration process. Moreover, most studies related to blockchain technology have merely examined the positive aspects. This study, on the contrary, discusses the technologic, ﬁnancial, organizational and environmental challenges that are confronted on a sectoral basis during the integration process. The fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods, which are used in uncertainties and are capable of simultaneous multi-criteria evaluation, were employed. Furthermore, it is intended to produce a study that is of beneﬁt to industrial actors by analyzing the ﬁndings related to the challenges merging during technological transformation. The outputs of this study are as follows: (i) High investment costs, data security and utility are important; (ii) integration is harder for the health and logistic sectors; (iii) the supply chains, which are less complicated, will be able to coordinate faster than the blockchain technology does. Consequently, the obtained results are evaluated, and strategic outputs are shared for the decision-makers aiming to integrate blockchain technology into the supply chain processes.},

	abstract = {We seek to guide operations management (OM) research on the implementation of supply chain traceability systems by identifying business requirements and the factors critical to successful implementation. We first motivate the need for implementing traceability systems in two very different industries—cobalt mining and pharmaceuticals—and present business requirements and critical success factors for implementation. Next, we describe how we carried out thematic analysis of practitioner and scholarly articles on implementing blockchain for supply chain traceability. Finally, we present our results pertaining to the needs of different stakeholders such as suppliers, consumers, and regulators. The business requirements for traceability systems are curbing illegal practices; improving sustainability performance; increasing operational efficiency; enhancing supply-chain coordination; and sensing market trends. Critical success factors for implementation are companies’ capabilities; collaboration; technology maturity; supply chain practices; leadership; and governance of the traceability efforts. These findings provide a nascent measurement model for empirical work and a foundation for descriptive and normative research on blockchain applications for supply chain traceability.},

Despite the development of cohort systems, the blockchain needs more development from the perspective of Malaysia. In addition, blockchain is the only cryptographic block currency that improves retail marketing. This study has critically analyzed the variables of the current research Framework of the blockchain implementation in retail market. Thus, this study aims to implement blockchain in retail market for increaseing customer benefits in order to improve the retail industrial supply chain activities. In order to achieve the main aim, this study comprises of two main phases, which are theorietical study, developemnt of proposed blockchain factors and its implementation. The blockchain experience of variables, blockchain management, blockchain transaction policy, blockchain adaption and implications were discussed gradually. Finally, we demonstrate the underlying theory, the theoretical framework and the hypotheses were discussed in detail.},
