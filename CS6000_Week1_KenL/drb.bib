	title = {Separation of {Reflection} {Components} {Using} {Color} and {Polarization}},
	abstract = {Specular reﬂections and interreﬂections produce strong highlights in brightness images. These highlights can cause vision algorithms for segmentation, shape from shading, binocular stereo, and motion estimation to produce erroneous results. A technique is developed for separating the specular and diffuse components of reﬂection from images. The approach is to use color and polarization information, simultaneously, to obtain constraints on the reﬂection components at each image point. Polarization yields local and independent estimates of the color of specular reﬂection. The result is a linear subspace in color space in which the local diffuse component must lie. This subspace constraint is applied to neighboring image points to determine the diffuse component. In contrast to previous separation algorithms, the proposed method can handle highlights on surfaces with substantial texture, smoothly varying diffuse reﬂectance, and varying material properties. The separation algorithm is applied to several complex scenes with textured objects and strong interreﬂections. The separation results are then used to solve three problems pertinent to visual perception; determining illumination color, estimating illumination direction, and shape recovery.},

	doi = {10.1109/BCC.2007.4430534},
	abstract = {This paper is a security analysis of leading privacy enhanced technologies (PETs) for biometrics including biometric fuzzy vaults (BFV) and biometric encryption (BE). The lack of published attacks, combined with various "proven" security properties has been taken by some as a sign that these technologies are ready for deployment. While some of the existing BFV and BE techniques do have "proven" security properties, those proofs make assumptions that may not, in general, be valid for biometric systems. We briefly review some of the other known attacks against BFV and BE techniques. We introduce three disturbing classes of attacks against PET techniques including attack via record multiplicity, surreptitious key-inversion attack, and novel blended substitution attacks. The paper ends with a discussion of the requirements for an architecture to address the privacy and security requirements.},

	doi = {10.1109/TPAMI.2012.256},
	abstract = {To date, almost all experimental evaluations of machine learning-based recognition algorithms in computer vision have taken the form of “closed set” recognition, whereby all testing classes are known at training time. A more realistic scenario for vision applications is “open set” recognition, where incomplete knowledge of the world is present at training time, and unknown classes can be submitted to an algorithm during testing. This paper explores the nature of open set recognition and formalizes its definition as a constrained minimization problem. The open set recognition problem is not well addressed by existing algorithms because it requires strong generalization. As a step toward a solution, we introduce a novel “1-vs-set machine,” which sculpts a decision space from the marginal distances of a 1-class or binary SVM with a linear kernel. This methodology applies to several different applications in computer vision where open set recognition is a challenging problem, including object recognition and face verification. We consider both in this work, with large scale cross-dataset experiments performed over the Caltech 256 and ImageNet sets, as well as face matching experiments performed over the Labeled Faces in the Wild set. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of machines adapted for open set evaluation compared to existing 1-class and binary SVMs for the same tasks.},
